# Networking

Many mobile apps need to load resources from a remote URL. You may want to make a POST request to a REST API, or you may need to fetch a chunk of static content from another server.

## [Fetch Api](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)

Fetch will seem familiar if you have used XMLHttpRequest or other networking APIs before

### Requests

```js
fetch("https://mywebsite.com/endpoint/", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    Accept: "application/json",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    firstParam: "yourValue",
    secondParam: "yourOtherValue"
  })
});
```
