# Networking

Many mobile apps need to load resources from a remote URL. You may want to make a POST request to a REST API, or you may need to fetch a chunk of static content from another server.

## [Fetch Api](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)

Fetch will seem familiar if you have used XMLHttpRequest or other networking APIs before. You may refer to MDN's guide on Using Fetch for additional information.
