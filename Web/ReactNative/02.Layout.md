# Layout

A component's height and width determine its size on the screen.

## Height and Width

The simplest way to set the dimensions of a component is by adding a fixed width and height to style. All dimensions in React Native are unitless, and represent density-independent pixels.

## Fixed Dimensions

Use flex in a component's style to have the component expand and shrink dynamically based on available space. Normally you will use flex: 1, which tells a component to fill all available space, shared evenly amongst other components with the same parent. The larger the flex given, the higher the ratio of space a component will take compared to its siblings.
