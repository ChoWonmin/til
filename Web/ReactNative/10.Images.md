# Images

## Static Image Resources

- Same system on Android and iOS.
- Images live in the same folder as your JavaScript code. Components are self-contained.
- No global namespace, i.e. you don't have to worry about name collisions.
- Only the images that are actually used will be packaged into your app.
- Adding and changing images doesn't require app recompilation, you can refresh the simulator as you normally do.
- The packager knows the image dimensions, no need to duplicate it in the code.
- Images can be distributed via npm packages.
- image dynamically (i.e. via flex) => set { width: undefined, height: undefined }

```js
<Image source={require("./my-icon.png")} />
// also my-icon.ios.png and my-icon.android.png
```

### Images for different screen densities

example

- check@2x.png, will be used on an iPhone 7
- check@3x.png will be used on an iPhone 7 Plus or a Nexus 5
- there is no image matching the screen density, the closest best option will be selected

```
.
├── button.js
└── img
    ├── check.png
    ├── check@2x.png
    └── check@3x.png
```

```js
<Image source={require("./img/check.png")} />
```

## Images From Hybrid App's Resources

Also you have to specify image dimensions manually.

- images included via Xcode asset catalogs or in the Android drawable folder

```js
<Image source={{ uri: "app_icon" }} style={{ width: 40, height: 40 }} />
```

- images in the Android assets folder, use the asset:/ scheme

```js
<Image
  source={{ uri: "asset:/app_icon.png" }}
  style={{ width: 40, height: 40 }}
/>
```
