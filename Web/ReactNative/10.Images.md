# Images

## Static Image Resources

- Same system on Android and iOS.
- Images live in the same folder as your JavaScript code. Components are self-contained.
- No global namespace, i.e. you don't have to worry about name collisions.
- Only the images that are actually used will be packaged into your app.
- Adding and changing images doesn't require app recompilation, you can refresh the simulator as you normally do.
- The packager knows the image dimensions, no need to duplicate it in the code.
- Images can be distributed via npm packages.
- image dynamically (i.e. via flex) => set { width: undefined, height: undefined }

```js
<Image source={require("./my-icon.png")} />
// also my-icon.ios.png and my-icon.android.png
```

### Images for different screen densities

example

- check@2x.png, will be used on an iPhone 7
- check@3x.png will be used on an iPhone 7 Plus or a Nexus 5
- there is no image matching the screen density, the closest best option will be selected

```
.
├── button.js
└── img
    ├── check.png
    ├── check@2x.png
    └── check@3x.png
```

```js
<Image source={require("./img/check.png")} />
```

## [Static Non-Image Resources(.mp3, .wav, .mp4, .mov, .html and .pdf)](https://github.com/facebook/metro/blob/master/packages/metro-config/src/defaults/defaults.js#L14-L44)

## Images From Hybrid App's Resources

Also you have to specify image dimensions manually.

- images included via Xcode asset catalogs or in the Android drawable folder

```js
<Image source={{ uri: "app_icon" }} style={{ width: 40, height: 40 }} />
```

- images in the Android assets folder, use the asset:/ scheme

```js
<Image
  source={{ uri: "asset:/app_icon.png" }}
  style={{ width: 40, height: 40 }}
/>
```

## Network Images

- need to manually specify the dimensions of your image
- use https as well in order to satisfy App Transport Security requirements on iOS

```js
<Image
  source={{ uri: "https://reactjs.org/logo-og.png" }}
  style={{ width: 400, height: 400 }}
/>

<Image
  source={{
    uri: 'https://reactjs.org/logo-og.png',
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      Pragma: 'no-cache',
    },
    body: 'Your Body goes here',
  }}
  style={{width: 400, height: 400}}
/>
```

### Uri Data Images

- encoded image data from a REST API call
- recommended for very small and dynamic images only, like icons in a list from a DB

```js
// include at least width and height!
<Image
  style={{
    width: 51,
    height: 51,
    resizeMode: "contain"
  }}
  source={{
    uri:
      "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAADMAAAAzCAYAAAA6oTAqAAAAEXRFWHRTb2Z0d2FyZQBwbmdjcnVzaEB1SfMAAABQSURBVGje7dSxCQBACARB+2/ab8BEeQNhFi6WSYzYLYudDQYGBgYGBgYGBgYGBgYGBgZmcvDqYGBgmhivGQYGBgYGBgYGBgYGBgYGBgbmQw+P/eMrC5UTVAAAAABJRU5ErkJggg=="
  }}
/>
```

### Cache Control (iOS)

## Local Filesystem Images

[CameraRoll](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-cameraroll)

### Best Camera Roll Image

iOS saves multiple sizes for the same image in your Camera Roll, it is very important to pick the one that's as close as possible for performance reasons. You wouldn't want to use the full quality 3264x2448 image as source when displaying a 200x200 thumbnail. If there's an exact match, React Native will pick it, otherwise it's going to use the first one that's at least 50% bigger in order to avoid blur when resizing from a close size. All of this is done by default so you don't have to worry about writing the tedious (and error prone) code to do it yourself.

## iOS Border Radius Styles

corner specific, border radius style properties are currently ignored by iOS's image component.
