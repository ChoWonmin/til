# Fast Refresh

- allows you to get near-instant feedback for changes in your React components
- module that only exports React component : update only for that module and re-render component
- module with exports that aren't React components : re-run both that module, and the other modules importing it.
- f you edit a file that's imported by modules outside of the React tree, Fast Refresh will fall back to doing a full reload.
