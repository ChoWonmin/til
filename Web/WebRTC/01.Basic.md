# Basic WebRTC

WebRTC allows real-time, peer-to-peer, media exchange between two devices. A connection is established through a discovery and negotiation process called signaling.

## adapter.js

JavaScript shim which lets your code to be written to the specification so that it will "just work" in all browsers with WebRTC support.

- all browsers have not fully implemented all of its features.
- some browsers still have prefixes on some or all WebRTC APIs.

## Buffering

WebRTC data channels support buffering of outbound data. This is handled automatically. While there's no way to control the size of the buffer, you can learn how much data is currently buffered, and you can choose to be notified by an event when the buffer starts to run low on queued data. This makes it easy to write efficient routines that make sure there's always data ready to send without over-using memory or swamping the channel completely.
