2. Receiver only send **cumulative ACK**
3. Sender has timer for oldest unpacked packet

## selective repeat

1. Sender can have up to N unacked packets in pipeline
2. Receiver sends **individual ACK** for each packet
3. Sender maintains timer for each unacked packet. When timer expires, retransmit only that unpacked packet.
