# PySpark

> Apache Spark is written in Scala programming language. To support Python with Spark, Apache Spark Community released a tool, PySpark. Using PySpark, you can work with RDDs in Python programming language also. It is because of a library called Py4j that they are able to achieve this.

> PySpark offers PySpark Shell which links the Python API to the spark core and initializes the Spark context. Majority of data scientists and analytics experts today use Python because of its rich library set. Integrating Python with Spark is a boon to them.
