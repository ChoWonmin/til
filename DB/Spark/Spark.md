# Spark

>  Spark is a unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing. It provides high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames, MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing, and Structured Streaming for stream processing.

> Apache Spark is a lightning fast real-time processing framework. It does in-memory computations to analyze data in real-time. It came into picture as Apache Hadoop MapReduce was performing batch processing only and lacked a real-time processing feature. Hence, Apache Spark was introduced as it can perform stream processing in real-time and can also take care of batch processing.
