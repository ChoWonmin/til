# AirFlow

Apache Airflow is an open-source workflow management platform. It started at Airbnb as a solution to manage the company's increasingly complex workflows.

Airflow is a platform created by the community to programmatically author, schedule and monitor workflows.

## Principles

- Scalable : Airflow has a modular architecture and uses a message queue to orchestrate an arbitrary number of workers. Airflow is ready to scale to infinity.

- Dynamic : Airflow pipelines are configuration as code (Python), allowing for dynamic pipeline generation. This allows for writing code that instantiates pipelines dynamically.

- Extensible : Easily define your own operators, executors and extend the library so that it fits the level of abstraction that suits your environment.

- Elegant : Airflow pipelines are lean and explicit. Parametrizing your scripts is built into its core using the powerful Jinja templating engine.
