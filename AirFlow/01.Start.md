# but you can lay foundation somewhere else if you prefer
# (optional)
export AIRFLOW_HOME=~/airflow

# install from pypi using pip
pip install apache-airflow

# initialize the database
airflow initdb

# start the web server, default port is 8080
airflow webserver -p 8080

# start the scheduler
airflow scheduler

# visit localhost:8080 in the browser and enable the example dag in the home page
```

```bash
airflow run example_bash_operator runme_0 2015-01-01
