# Basic Relationships between Pixels

1. Neighborhood
2. Adjacency
3. Connectivity
4. Paths
5. Regions and Boundaries

## Neighborhood

- Neighbors of a pixel p at coordinates (x,y)

- 4-neighbors of **p**, denoted by N<sub>4</sub>(**p**):

  - (x-1, y), (x+1, y), (x,y-1), and (x, y+1)

- 4 diagonal neighbors of **p**, denoted by N<sub>D</sub>(**p**):

  - (x-1, y-1), (x+1, y+1), (x+1,y-1), and (x-1, y+1)

- 8 neighbors of **p**, denoted N<sub>8</sub>(**p**)
  - N<sub>8</sub>(**p**) = N<sub>4</sub>(**p**) ∪ N<sub>D</sub>(**p**)

## Adjacency

- Let _V_ be the set of intensity values

- 4-adjacency

  - Two pixels **p** and **q** with values from _V_ are 4-adjacent ↔ **q** ∈ N<sub>4</sub>(**p**)

- 8-adjacency

  - Two pixels **p** and **q** with values from _V_ are 8-adjacent ↔ **q** is in the set N<sub>8</sub>(**p**)

- M-adjacency
